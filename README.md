Description:-

The Sole Shopper project is a straightforward shopping application that runs on a console interface. Its purpose is to allow users to choose and buy shoes from three popular brands: Nike, Adidas, and Puma. Users 
have the ability to add shoes to their virtual shopping cart, remove items from the cart, generate a bill with the total cost, and complete the payment process using UPI (Unified Payments Interface).

This project consists of several functions, each responsible for handling different steps in the shopping process. The main() function acts as the starting point and asks the user for their personal details like name, phone number, age, and address. Afterward, it presents a menu displaying options such as browsing for shoes, viewing the cart, removing items from the cart, generating a bill, or exiting the program. Depending on the user's selection, the corresponding function is called to carry out the desired action.

To store the selected items and their prices, the project utilizes lists and dictionaries. It also incorporates input validation techniques to ensure that users enter valid information and make appropriate choices throughout their shopping experience.

Functionality:-

Gathering User Information:
Users are asked to provide their name, phone number, age, and address.
The phone number and age inputs are checked to ensure they meet the required criteria.
Shopping Experience:

Users are given a menu of options to shop, where they can add or remove items from their cart.
The available shoe brands (Nike, Adidas, Puma) are shown, and users can select the brand they want to shop for.
Each brand presents specific shoe models, and users can choose their desired model to add it to their cart.
Managing the Cart:

Users can easily see the contents of their cart, including the items they have added and their respective prices.
Users have the ability to remove items from their cart by selecting the item number.
Generating the Bill:

Users can generate a bill for the items in their cart, which provides a breakdown of each item's name and price.
The total cost of the items in the cart is calculated and shown.
Payment Process:

Users are asked if they would like to proceed with the payment.
If users choose to proceed, they are prompted to enter their UPI ID for payment.
A confirmation message is displayed, confirming the amount paid and the UPI ID used.
Exiting the Program:

Users have the option to quit the program at any time.
How to Run the Project:-
Here are the simplified steps to run the Sole Shopper project:

Make sure you have Python installed on your computer.

Download the sole_shopper.py file and save it in the folder you prefer.

Open a terminal or command prompt and go to the folder where you saved the sole_shopper.py file.

Run the program by executing a command.

The program will ask you for specific information like your name, phone number, age, and address. Provide the requested details.

Once the program starts, you'll see a menu. Choose an action by entering the corresponding number (1-5):

ENTER 1 if you want to shop for shoes from available brands.
ENTER 2 to see the items in your cart.
ENTER 3 to remove items from your cart.
ENTER 4 to generate a bill.
ENTER 5 to exit the program.
Follow the instructions on the screen to shop for shoes, manage your cart, generate a bill, and make a payment using UPI.

When you finish the shopping session, the program will end, and you'll receive a confirmation message.
